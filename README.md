# Coffee Tracker

## Setup instructions

To run the program in a browser you will need to have yarn (or npm) installed.

Before your first run and for your tests to work, **you must** install the node dependencies with:

```sh
yarn install
```

This example uses Parcel.js as our bundler and dev server, there are lots of other options you might prefer like Webpack, scalajs-bunder, or even just vanilla JavaScript.

We recommend you have two terminal tabs open in the directory containing this README file.

In the first, we'll run sbt.

```sh
sbt
```

From now on, we can recompile the app with `fastLinkJS` or `fullLinkJS` _**but please note** that the `tyrianapp.js` file in the root is expecting the output from `fastLinkJS`_.

Run `fastLinkJS` now to get an initial build in place.

Then start your dev server, with:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) to see your site running.

If you leave parcel's dev server running, all you have to do is another `fastLinkJS` or `fullLinkJS` and your app running in the browser should hot-reload the new code.

## Supported Effect Types

From version `0.6.0`, Tyrian supports both Cats Effect 3 and ZIO 2.0. This template defaults to CE3 and IO (as this is the author's habit), but there is an example of a [ZIO tyrian project](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/blob/main/examples) available, and conversion is fairly straightforward.

The [build](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/blob/main/examples/build.sbt#L153) for the ZIO example has libraries that you need to add/replace. You need to set up the right [imports](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/blob/main/examples/zio/src/main/scala/example/Main.scala#L6) and replace `IO` with [`Task`](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/blob/main/examples/zio/src/main/scala/example/Main.scala#L13).

Otherwise, it's identical.

## Supported Build Tools

Tyrian works equally well with sbt or Mill. Most of the examples are given in sbt, and this g8 template uses sbt too. However there is a [Mill example](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/tree/main/examples/mill) project that serves as a good starting point.
